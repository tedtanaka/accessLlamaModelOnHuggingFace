checked email for approved model, updated code
worked!
but downloads 22GB! takes 5-10 minutes

windows doesn't support symlinks, will download copies of model files


UserWarning: `huggingface_hub` cache-system uses symlinks by default to efficiently store duplicated files but your machine does not support them in C:\Users\Ted\.cache\huggingface\hub\models--meta-llama--Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct. Caching files will still work but in a degraded version that might require more space on your disk. 

To support symlinks on Windows, you either need to activate Developer Mode or to run Python as an administrator. In order to activate developer mode, see this article: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development
